I am really happy with the progress that I have been making with the site. I feel like I have really embraced the ethos of hacking and I find myself having an easier time letting go of what my past self would consider the "right" way to do something, and instead opting for what I think my future self would consider the right path forward to be. I have been thinking critically about how I am choosing to spend my time coding and having check-ins with myself when I feel like I might be spinning my wheels.

Most recently I got the collaborative editor working which feels so cool to have running. It isn't perfect, but for the amount of time I have put into it and what it can do, it is so cool. The work was taking two existing projects: <https://github.com/x1unix/go-playground> and [https://github.com/Jeffail/leaps and merging them together. It took a reasonable amount of work to understand each project well enough to know where to hook in certain code. I have also been actively removing/reorganizing to distill down exactly I am building. My theory is if I keep these iteration cycles of writing a bunch of code and then refactoring it, I will be proving out if the language that I am writing is working at improving my development work flow.](https://github.com/Jeffail/leaps)
