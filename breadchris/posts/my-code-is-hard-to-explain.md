I am currently at a weekly jam session at a bar called Mo Jam Mondays. It is pretty fun to hang out here so that I get a chance to play bass live and while I wait for my turn, write some code to some improvised music. In many ways, my style of writing code is similar to improvised music. I have a general goal of writing code that "feels good", but it is often difficult to understand what I am actually going to write until I start writing it.

I had someone check out my computer and ask "what are you working on?" to which I responded "that is a difficult question to answer". It is the truth. In my feeble attempt to talk about the capabilities of the code I have written, I was met with a blank stare. Either he in deep concentration considering the social impact of my genius or, what is more likely, I had confused the shit out of him.

It would be much more satisfying to write code that I could adequately explain. This is something that I continue to struggle to do effectively and a focus of mine as I sit down to write something.

A goal that I have is to put some polish on the blog code that I have written and release a v0.0.1 so that others could start to use it. It would be rewarding to connect to people in the Go community and get their mind share in helping me coalesce the ideas in my head into something that I could explain to a sane human.

It is the last 10% of effort that is always the hardest and I feel like it is due time to put in that effort!
