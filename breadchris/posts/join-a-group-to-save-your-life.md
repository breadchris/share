community to me is a place and people. if you go to a place often enough and engage with the people there, then you are a part of a community. knowing if it is the right community is something you can only figure out if you are involved in other communities as well. diverse experience of life will help you determine where you should be spending your time. develop an intuition for what feels right by seeing good things happening in communities.
