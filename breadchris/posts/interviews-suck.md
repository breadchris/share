title: interviews suck
---

I feel like being put on a hospital bed and prodded every time I am in an interview. A rigid agenda of a strange conversation where the person on the other end is trying to profile you. It is an extraordinary interaction that I really hope improves over time. I usually get greeted by a nice interviewer, or someone trying to play nice at least, for the roles I am applying to. When it ends, you get casual follow-up emails and calendar invites, and then you talk with other people. Now, it is the recruiter's job to be a nice person who is welcoming. Everyone else is a specialist in their field who is being torn away from their flow of day-to-day activities for their "jury duty."
