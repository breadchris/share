Beyond what the button does, it also captures intent. The user desires to interact with this button because they want what it offers. If clicking this button results in the desired outcome, it is a good button. Of all the buttons on the Internet, there is one that I consistently think about:

Cloudflare built its brand by offering a reliable service for defending against [DDOS attacks](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/famous-ddos-attacks/). The poor soul who is in charge of responding to an incident will look for a solution. Maybe they search for "ddos service."

After finding Cloudflare, they can immediately see a button that solves their problem. Clicking on it will immediately guide them through onboarding, and once their issue is resolved, Cloudflare will have yet another customer.

Figuring out how to build good buttons is a skill that may seem trivial, but the best buttons take an incredible amount of thought and effort.
