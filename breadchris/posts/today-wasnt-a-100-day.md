title: Today wasn't a 100% day
---

Idk what happened this morning but I went through my normal routine and then something just hit me which crippled my momentum. I have learned that listening to my body and trying to meet it where it is at in the moment vs trying to fight the feeling pays dividends over time. I try to map the feeling to a probability of what it is that I need. Often this feeling comes from not having enough water, so I drank some water and took a 20 minute nap. I went to my bed with the purpose to sleep and not to linger on my phone. Waking up from this nap felt amazing and the rest of my day started to look brighter in terms of me getting to do what I wanted to do. Everyone's body is different, but there are foundational needs that we have to meet if we want to keep our energy up. Check in with yourself when you are feeling off to try to figure out what need your body is trying to tell you.
