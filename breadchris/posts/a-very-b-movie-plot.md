Title: Eternal Connection

FADE IN:

INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

ISABELLA and JAMES sit across from each other, laughing and enjoying each other's company.

JAMES

You always make me feel like I'm in a dream when I'm with you.

ISABELLA

And you always make me feel like the most beautiful girl in the world.

Suddenly, a WOMAN approaches their table.

WOMAN

Excuse me, are you Isabella?

ISABELLA

Yes, that's me. Can I help you?

WOMAN

I have something for you. It's a memory erasing device. You requested to have all memories of James deleted.

ISABELLA and JAMES exchange confused looks.

ISABELLA

I never requested that. I would never want to forget any moment with James.

The WOMAN apologizes and walks away, leaving Isabella and James shaken.

JAMES

What was that all about? Are you sure you didn't request that?

ISABELLA

I swear I didn't, James. I would never want to erase any memories of us.

They both ponder the strange encounter, but ultimately brush it off and continue their day.

INT. JAMES' APARTMENT - NIGHT

Isabella enters James' apartment, but he seems distant and distracted.

ISABELLA

James, what's wrong? You've been acting strange ever since that woman approached us.

JAMES

I don't know, Isabella. It just got me thinking about our relationship.

ISABELLA

What do you mean?

JAMES

I've been feeling like maybe we're growing apart. Maybe we're just not meant to be.

Isabella is devastated by James' words, but she refuses to give up on their love.

ISABELLA

No, James. I refuse to believe that. Our connection is too strong to let anything come between us.

JAMES

I don't know, Isabella. I need some time to think.

Isabella leaves James' apartment, heartbroken and confused.

INT. ISABELLA'S ART STUDIO - DAY

Isabella sits at her easel, painting a portrait of James, tears falling down her cheeks.

Suddenly, the WOMAN from the coffee shop appears in her studio.

WOMAN

I'm sorry, Isabella. I made a mistake. It wasn't you who requested the memory erasing device.

ISABELLA

Then who did?

WOMAN

It was James. He requested to erase all memories of you.

Isabella is stunned by the revelation.

INT. PARK - DAY

Isabella races to the park where she and James shared so many memories. She finds him sitting on a bench, staring blankly ahead.

ISABELLA

James, why did you do it? Why did you want to erase me from your life?

JAMES

I don't know, Isabella. I thought it would be easier to forget than to face the pain of losing you.

ISABELLA

But the pain of losing you is so much greater. Our connection is too strong to let anything come between us.

They embrace, tears streaming down their faces, as they realize that their love is eternal and cannot be erased.
