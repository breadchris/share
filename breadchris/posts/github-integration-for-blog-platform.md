Feels good to be one step closer to my goal of having a blogging platform with [this code](https://github.com/breadchris/share/blob/master/github.go#L54). This adds an entire flow (MVP of course) for someone signing up with github, cloning their "blog" repo, generating the static assets to push to their repo, which would be served with github pages.

With some polish and setup instructions, I think this is good to ship!
