title: what happened to irc?
---

I get that it took a while for IRCv3 to come out, but the more I think about my ideal form of communication, the more it looks like IRC. I mostly communicate with Simple text comms, with the occasional voice/video chat. I also want to be able to write bots to receive and send messages on channels. Moderation controls are important for larger channels.

There is a Go server/client implementation, [ergo](https://github.com/ergochat/ergo), that I am excited to try out.
