Ideas need time to grow. They start small based on observing something in passing, but start to take shape once more data is collected. Having a conceptual model about what you are working on is helpful if you want to make sure you are working on the right thing, but take time to take shape. The less of a mental model that you have, the more risky it is to work on. Drawing sketches of ideas to capture fragments of how your mind understand things is a great way to check to see if what you think your idea is actually makes sense.
