@KoaKilla figure out how to make this our baseline production value [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3s0BtrBJpwNDaflRSoiieQ](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3s0BtrBJpwNDaflRSoiieQ)

34m oh god. not their new content

34m oh wow, you have to go back 6 years [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tv6DyyvfPlw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tv6DyyvfPlw)

33m Free Wortley Can you link a specific video Thanks

33m [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8-7lhs4ky0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8-7lhs4ky0)

32m like i want to watch this content because it is well edited and cute lady talking about computers

32m we need to make an idea board of inspiration for the podcast

31m like as we see articles online, putting them into a "talking points" thing

31m Free Wortley Is there a good place for me to share/save something when I see it? (I will probably just paste it here)

27m yeah start by pasting it here

25m i am working on the groups system for just share right now

25m Free Wortley We could probably get pretty far by just making videos talking about the latest AI news. Maybe in a format similar to this Hak5 stuff

25m so we can have a shared doc to edit

24m when people add stuff to it, i will email us a summary of the changes so we get notified

24m Free Wortley We could probably get pretty far by just making videos talking about the latest AI news. Maybe in a format similar to this Hak5 stuff that is a good one

24m the reason that it works so well is that it is in person

24m Free Wortley Maybe while you're gone, I can just record some videos of myself talking through stuff?

23m so @Free Wortley when information comes out, we need to be with each other in person, and then just hit record

23m Free Wortley You so @Free Wortley when information comes out, we need to be with each other in person, and then just hit record Sweet

23m that is good, but you should at least be talking with koa or something

23m one person talking is not interesting enough

23m not worth your time making content unless you are a very engaging individual which is not easy 23m [https://www.youtube.com/c/theprimeagen](https://www.youtube.com/c/theprimeagen)

22m this guy is the most successful senior engineer on youtube

22m and it is because he is deeply knowledgeable, but also very reactive 22m K KoaKilla this kinda of production is super easy to recreate

22m in the parasocial relationship, the viewer needs to feel as if you are in person with them, to get that illusion to work you need to be very engaging on screen. 22m Free Wortley That hak5 video talking about how to use gzip is a basic example of one person though. Tutorials don't need to be conversational, do they? 21m K KoaKilla i have some motion graphics experience too i could make it much more interesting looking than this example channel 21m K KoaKilla i cant to anything about the lack of tits and my dick unfortunately 21m Free Wortley I can write very interesting visuals also. And I can teach you how they work in the code @KoaKilla KoaKilla i cant to anything about the lack of tits and my dick unfortunately Not with that attitude 20m Free Wortley That hak5 video talking about how to use gzip is a basic example of one person though. Tutorials don't need to be conversational, do they? she is girl 20m get nova to talk about computer stuff 20m and we will be at 10k subs in a week, easy 20m Free Wortley Mmk I could probably do that. Walk her through some content on the latest Google Gemma model and record her Ubuntu laptop lol 20m KoaKilla i cant to anything about the lack of tits and my dick unfortunately koa, i want to pay you to learn how to use this [https://motioncanvas.io/](https://motioncanvas.io/) 19m the prereq is knowing typescript, but you can get chatgpt to teach you 19m i will find a good book recommendation for learning typescript 19m 2 Unread Messages Free Wortley Very cool. I watched his video at the bottom and that's a cool library. It's content I've learned in the past from being a game dev. (Normals, light calculations, etc) We can definitely make some very cool visuals. Take the above text and split it on a regex that selects sequences that look like
