title: Why is fiction important
---

So, I have been told that I need to read Foundation by Isaac Asimov, and there is a reason for this. What is that reason? It depends on the importance of knowledge and information to the survival of society, and it's very pertinent today, even though it was written before the Internet was invented.

When was the editor so? I think it doesn't show up; I need to re-implement it, but I could do/ask if it's there.

I have been reading a lot of nonfiction recently, and it's exciting to learn about history, but when you're reading fiction, it expands your mind to think about theoretical futures that were headed towards, and something as foundational as the foundation is probably a good book to look for ideas of what potential future we're headed towards
