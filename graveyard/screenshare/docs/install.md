# Installation

Latest Version: **GITHUB_VERSION**

Before starting Screego you may read [Configuration](config.md).

!> TLS is required for Screego to work. Either enable TLS inside Screego or 
   use a reverse proxy to serve Screego via TLS.

## Docker

Setting up Screego with docker is pretty easy, you basically just have to start the docker container, and you are ready to go:

[ghcr.io/screego/server](https://github.com/orgs/screego/packages/container/package/server) and
[screego/server](https://hub.docker.com/r/screego/server)
docker images are multi-arch docker images.
This means the image will work for `amd64`, `i386`, `ppc64le` (power pc), `arm64`, `armv7` (Raspberry PI) and `armv6`.

By default, Screego runs on port 5050.

?> Replace `EXTERNALIP` with your external IP. One way to find your external ip is with ipify.
   `curl 'https://api.ipify.org'`

```bash
$ docker run --net=host -e SCREEGO_EXTERNAL_IP=EXTERNALIP ghcr.io/screego/server:GITHUB_VERSION
```

**docker-compose.yml**
```yaml
version: "3.7"
services:
  screego:
    image: ghcr.io/screego/server:GITHUB_VERSION
    network_mode: host
    environment:
      SCREEGO_EXTERNAL_IP: "EXTERNALIP"
```

If you don't want to use the host network, then you can configure docker like this:

<p>

```bash
$ docker run -it \
    -e SCREEGO_EXTERNAL_IP=EXTERNALIP \
    -e SCREEGO_TURN_PORT_RANGE=50000:50200 \
    -p 5050:5050 \
    -p 3478:3478 \
    -p 50000-50200:50000-50200/udp \
    screego/server:GITHUB_VERSION
```

#### docker-compose.yml

```yml
version: "3.7"
services:
  screego:
    image: ghcr.io/screego/server:GITHUB_VERSION
    ports:
      - 5050:5050
      - 3478:3478
      - 50000-50200:50000-50200/udp
    environment:
      SCREEGO_EXTERNAL_IP: "192.168.178.2"
      SCREEGO_TURN_PORT_RANGE: "50000:50200"
```
