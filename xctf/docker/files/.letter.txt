Sarah,

You probably don’t know me—not really. We've only crossed paths a few times at competitions between Turning and Möbius, and even then, you likely wouldn’t have noticed me. I’ve always stayed in the background, happier observing from afar. It's sort of my thing.

I admire the care and attention you put into everything you do. The way you take notes with such precision, your amazing papercrafts, your dedication to details—it's inspiring. I wish I had the courage to talk to you directly, but words fail me whenever I try. So, here I am, writing instead.

If you ever need someone to listen, or even just solve crossword puzzles together, I'll be here—quietly cheering you on.

Good luck with everything,
—g3tl0st
