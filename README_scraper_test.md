# Scraper Test Results: Mobbin Midjourney

## Test Summary
This test attempted to scrape Midjourney design images from https://mobbin.com/apps/midjourney using the codebase's scraper infrastructure.

## Key Findings

### 1. Authentication Required
- The page contains "sign in" text, indicating authentication is required
- No images were found in the initial page load

### 2. Dynamic Content Loading
- Zero `<img>` elements found in the HTML
- This is a React/Next.js application that loads content dynamically
- Images are likely loaded via JavaScript after authentication

### 3. Scraper Infrastructure Analysis

The codebase contains two scraper components:

#### `/Users/hacked/Documents/GitHub/share/scraper.go`
- **Purpose**: Flexible scraper supporting both HTTP client and Chrome (chromedp) for dynamic content
- **Key Features**:
  - Chrome browser automation via chromedp
  - HTTP client fallback option
  - Configurable timeouts and user agents
  - Proxy support
- **Interface**: `Scraper.Scrape(url string) (*Response, error)`
- **Configuration**: `ScrapeConfig` with client type, fallback options, caching

#### `/Users/hacked/Documents/GitHub/share/scrape.go`  
- **Purpose**: Recursive crawler using geziyor for bulk site crawling
- **Key Features**:
  - Follows links automatically
  - Saves files to local directory structure
  - Handles duplicate URL detection
- **Interface**: `Crawler.Crawl(url string) error`

### 4. Test Implementation

The test successfully:
- ✅ Used Chrome-based scraper for JavaScript-rendered content
- ✅ Detected authentication requirements
- ✅ Saved page HTML for analysis
- ✅ Attempted multiple image extraction strategies
- ✅ Provided detailed logging and debugging information

## Next Steps

To successfully scrape Mobbin images, you would need to:

1. **Authentication**: Implement login flow before scraping
2. **Dynamic Loading**: Wait for JavaScript to load image elements
3. **API Analysis**: Investigate if Mobbin has an API or uses XHR requests for image data
4. **Rate Limiting**: Implement proper delays to avoid being blocked

## Files Generated
- `data/mobbin/midjourney/page_content.html` - Saved HTML for analysis
- Test output with detailed logging in console

## Usage Example

```go
// Basic scraper usage
config := ScrapeConfig{
    Client:   ClientChrome,  // Use Chrome for JS-heavy sites
    Fallback: true,         // Fall back to HTTP if Chrome fails
    UseCache: false,        // Don't cache for testing
}

scraper := NewScraper(config)
resp, err := scraper.Scrape("https://example.com")
if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}

// resp.Content contains the HTML
// resp.Title contains the page title
// resp.ContentType contains the content type
```
