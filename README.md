# share
you know what makes me annoyed. when I can't share something easily. i am going to change that.

## hack

run the code yourself.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/breadchris/share.git
cd share
go run . start
```

create a [digital ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) droplet and run the code there.
I want to make hosting easier, so if you have an idea, create an issue.
